ðŸŒ± AIoT Wireless Sensor Network iClimate in Greenhouse with LSTM & Reinforcement Learning

![iClimate System](./scrnli_XqwpnePikJp5vr.png)

Overview
iClimate is an intelligent greenhouse climate management system that leverages AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things), LSTM deep learning, and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to create a fully autonomous and energy-efficient environment for crop cultivation.

By deploying a wireless sensor network, the system continuously gathers real-time data on key environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, and COâ‚‚ levels. These data points are then fed into an LSTM-based model to accurately forecast future conditions. The RL algorithm dynamically adjusts actuators (like fans, heaters, humidifiers) to maintain optimal growing conditions â€” minimizing energy use while maximizing plant growth and yield.
