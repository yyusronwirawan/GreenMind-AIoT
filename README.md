This project integrates AIoT-based wireless sensor networks to monitor and control the microclimate inside a greenhouse. By utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, the system predicts future environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and COâ‚‚ levels. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is applied to optimize the greenhouse climate control strategies in real-time, aiming to enhance crop yield and reduce energy consumption. The system ensures efficient, autonomous, and intelligent climate management for smart agriculture applications.
